# Algorithmic_Design

Repository of my notes and exercises on the course of Algorithmic Design by Prof. Alberto Casagrande at the University of Trieste in the year 2020/2021.

It is made of:

- `Algorithmic_Design_Notes.pdf`: a pdf file containing my LaTex notes on the course, updated after every lecture.
- `Homework_*`: directories containing my solution to the homeworks issued during the course.
- `Section_Name`: directories containing the code implemented in class for every algorithm studied. The name of the directory corresponds to the name of the chapter in `Algorithmic_Design_Notes.pdf` it is related to.

I've noticed quite a bit of traffic on this repository lately. If you find this repository useful, leaving a star would be appreciated ;-)
